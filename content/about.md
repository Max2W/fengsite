Hi, I am **Feng Wang (王丰)**, a researcher in RNA biology.

My research interests involve the use of cutting-edge sequencing technology to better understand transcriptome, translatome, and proteome in eukaryotic cells; as well as applications of experimental biology tools and models to study RNA mis-splicing and interrogate gene function in human disease and therapy.
