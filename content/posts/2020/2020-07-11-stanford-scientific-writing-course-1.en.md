Stanford Scientific Writing Course by Kristin Sainani

## Introduction            

The goals that I have for you for this course is to get you to rethink your writing process a little bit, help you rethink your approach to writing, and ease some fears that you may have around writing. I'm gonna just jump right in with some key principles of effective writing.

1. Good writing is to communicate an idea clearly and effectively. 
2. Good writing is elegant and stylish.
3. Having something to say
4. Logical thinking
5. A few rules of style
6. Read, pay attention, and imitate
7. Write in a journal
8. Talk about your research before trying to write about it
9. write to engage your readers --- try not to bore them!
10. Stop waiting for "Inspiration"
11. Accept that writing is hard for everyone
12. Revise. Nobody gets it perfect on the first try
13. Learn how to cut ruthlessly. Never become top attached to your words
14. Find a good editor!
15. Take risks.

## Examples of what not to do

### #1  spunky verbs become clunky nouns

> Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy is based on the ex vivo selection of tumor-reactive lymphocytes, and their activation and numerical expression before reinfusion to the autologous tumor-bearing host.

### #2 

> These findings imply that the rates of ascorbate radical production and its recycling via dehydroascorbate reductase to replenish the ascorbate pool are equivalent at the lower irradiance, but not equivalent at higher irradiance with the rate of ascorbate radical production exceeding its recycling back to ascorbate.

Translation of #2: 

> These findings imply that, at low irradiation, ascorbate radicals are produced and recycled at the same rate, but at high irradiation, they are produced faster than they can be recycled back to ascorbate.

Complex ideas don't require complex language, Scientific writing should be easy and even enjoyable to read!

Publish or Perish!

## Principles of effective writing

### NOT to do

1. use of nouns instead of verbs
2. vague words
3. use of unnecessary jargon and acronyms
4. use of passive voice
5. long distance between the subject and the main verb of the sentence 

### Principles

1. Cut unnecessary words
2. Use the active voice
3. Write with verbs: use strong verbs, avoid turning verbs into nouns, don't bury the main verb

## Cut the clutter

> "The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what --- These are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence."

> --- William Zinsser in On Writing Well, 1976

### #1 

> This paper provides a review of the basic tenets of cancer biology study design, using as examples studies that illustrate the methodologic challenges or that demonstrate successful solutions to the difficulties inherent in biological research.

Translation:

>This paper reviews cancer biology study design, using examples that illustrate the challenges and solutions.

### #2

>As it is well known, increased athletic activity has been related to a profile of lower cardiovascular risk, lower blood pressure levels, and improved muscular and cardio-respiratory performance.

Translation:

>Increased athletic activity is associated with lower cardiovascular risk, lower blood pressure, and improved fitness.

>Increased athletic activity lowers cardiovascular risk and blood pressure, and improves fitness.

### Common clutter

1. Dead weight words and phrases

   >as it is well known
   >
   >as it has been shown 
   >
   >it can be regarded that
   >
   >it should be emphasized that

2. Empty words and phrases

   > basic tenets of
   >
   > methodologic
   >
   > important

3. long words that could be short

   >muscular and cardio-respiratory performance

4. Unnecessary jargon and acronyms

   > Gliomagenesis
   >
   > miR

5. Repetitive  words

   > illustrate/demonstrate
   >
   > challenges/difficulties
   >
   > successful solutions

6. Adverbs

   >very, really, quite, basically, generally, etc.

## More tricks of cutting the clutter

### Eliminate negatives

> She did not want to perform the experiment incorrectly
>
> She wanted to perform the experiment correctly

### Eliminate there are/ there is

> The data conform that there is an association between vegetables and cancer
>
> The data conform an association between vegetables and cancer

### Omit needless prepositions

For example, ***That*** and ***on*** are often superfluous

> They agreed (that) it was true

## Practice cutting clutter

### #1 

> Anti-inflammatory drugs may be protective for the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease.

***Edit:*** Anti-inflammatory drugs may protect against Alzheimer's disease.

### #2

>Clinical seizures have been estimated to occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal population.

***Edit:*** Clinical seizures occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of newborns.

### #3

> Ultimately p53 guards not only against malignant transformation but also plays a role in developmental processes as diverse as aging, differentiation, and fertility.

***Edit:*** Besides preventing malignant transformation, p53 also plays roles in aging, differentiation, and fertility.

### #4

> As we can see from Figure 2, if the return kinetic energy is less than 3.2 Up, there will be two electron trajectories associated with this kinetic energy.

***Edit:*** The figure 2 shows that a return kinetic energy less than 3.2 Up yields two electron trajectories.
