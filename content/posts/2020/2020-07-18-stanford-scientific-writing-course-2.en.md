### Use the active voice

### Is it really OK to use "We" and "I" in scientific manuscript 

-> Yes, it's OK!

1. The active voice is livelier and easier to read
2. It's a myth that avoiding first-person pronouns lends objectivity to the paper.
3. The style guidelines for many journals explicitly instruct authors to write in the active voice.

### When is it OK to use the passive voice? 

-> The methods section

### Practice

> The fear expressed by some teachers that students would not learn statistics well if they were permitted to use canned computer programs has not been realized in our experience. A careful monitoring of achievement levels before and after the introduction of computers in the teaching of our course revealed no appreciable change in students' performances.

Edit:

> Many teachers feared that the use of canned computer programs would prevent students from learning statistics. We monitored student achievement levels before and after the introduction of computers in our course and found no detriments in performance.

### Write with verbs

1. use strong verbs

   > Loud music came from speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena moved as the hungry crowd got to its feet.

   **Edit:**  

   > Loud music exploded from speakers embedded in the walls, and the entire arena shook as the hungry crowd leaped to its feet.

2. avoid turning verbs into nouns

   >During DNA damage, recognition of H3K4me3 by ING2 results in recruitment of Sin3/HDAC and repression of cell proliferation genes.

   **Edit:**  

   > During DNA damage, H3K4me3 recruits ING2 and Sin3/HDAC, which together repress cell proliferation genes.

3. don't bury the main verb

### A few Grammar  tips

1. "Data are" not "Data is"

2. Affect vs. effect

3. Compared to vs. compared with

   - Compare to = to point out similarities between different things

   - Compare with = to point out differences between similar things (used more in science)

4. That vs. which

   - "That" is the restrictive (defining) pronoun

   - "Which" is the nonrestrictive (non-defining) pronoun
